(Grading) s
5 100 M
(=======) s
5 92 M
(Your project will be graded in part on correctness and the quality of moves) s
5 84 M
(chosen by chooseMove\(\).  This grading will be done with automatic test cases.) s
5 76 M
(Be sure the following statements apply to your chooseMove\(\).) s
5 60 M
(  1\)  forceMove and opponentMove return true if the given move is legal.) s
5 52 M
(  2\)  forceMove and opponentMove return false if the given move is illegal.) s
5 44 M
(  3\)  chooseMove returns only legal moves.) s
5 36 M
(  4\)  If a winning move exists, chooseMove selects one.  \(This will happen) s
5 28 M
(      automatically if you are searching one level of the game tree.\)) s
5 20 M
(  5\)  If you cannot win in this step, but can prevent your opponent from) s
5 12 M
(      winning during its next move, chooseMove selects a move that does this.) s
5 4 M
(      \(This will happen automatically if you are searching two levels of the) s

(  6\)  Your player can beat the random player almost every time.  Any reasonable) s
376 500 M

(You will also be graded on style, documentation, efficiency, and the use of) s

(encapsulation.) s
376 460 M
(  1\)  Every method must be preceded by a comment describing its behavior) s
376 452 M
(      unambiguously.  These comments must include descriptions of what each) s
376 444 M
(      parameter is for, and what the method returns \(if anything\).) s
376 436 M
(      They must also include a description of what the method does \(though) s
376 428 M
(      not necessarily how it does it\) detailed enough that somebody else could) s
376 420 M
(      implement a method that does the same thing from scratch, using only the) s
376 412 M
(      comments and this readme file.) s

(      Some methods serve as entry points to the modules you designed when) s

(      you began the project.  The prototypes and behavioral descriptions of) s

(  3\)  There are no asymptotic limits on running time.  However, part of your) s

(      job is to avoid using inefficient algorithms and data structures.  If) s

(  4\)  You should have divided up the tasks into well-defined modules in your) s

(      GRADER file and in your software.) s
376 292 M
(  5\)  We will deduct points for code that does not match the following style) s
376 284 M
(      guidelines.) s
376 268 M
(  - Classes that contain extraneous debugging code, print statements, or) s
376 260 M
(    meaningless comments that make the code hard to read will be penalized.) s
376 252 M
(    \(It's okay to have methods whose sole purpose is to contain lots of) s

376 228 M
(    anything necessary to the functioning of your project.\)) s
376 220 M
(  - Your file should be indented in the manner enforced by Emacs \(e.g., a) s
376 212 M
(    two-space or four-space indentation inside braces\), and used in the lecture) s
376 204 M
(    notes throughout the semester.  The indentation should clearly show the) s
376 196 M
(    structure of nested statements like loops and if statements.  Sloppy) s
376 188 M
(    indentation will be penalized.) s
376 180 M
(  - All if, else, while, do, and for statements should use braces.  \(Ask me if) s
376 172 M
(    you want to know why.\)) s
376 164 M
(  - All classes start with a capital letter, all methods and \(non-final\) data) s
376 156 M
(    fields start with a lower case letter, and in both cases, each new word) s
376 148 M
(    within the name starts with a capital letter.  Constants \(final fields\) are) s
376 140 M
(    all capital letters only.) s
376 132 M
(  - Numerical constants with special meaning should always be represented by) s
376 124 M
(    all-caps "final static" constants.) s
376 116 M
(  - All class, method, field, and variable names should be meaningful to a) s
376 108 M
(    human reader.  \(Single-letter loop variables whose meanings are obvious are) s
376 100 M
(    okay.\)) s
376 92 M
(  - Methods should not exceed about 100 lines.  Any method that long can) s
376 84 M
(    probably be broken up into logical pieces.  The same is probably true for) s
376 76 M
(    any method that needs more than 8 levels of indentation.) s
376 68 M
(  - Avoid unnecessary duplicated code; if you use the same \(or very similar\)) s
376 60 M
(    fifteen lines of code in two different places, those lines should probably) s
376 52 M
(    be a separate method call.) s
376 44 M
(  - Programs should be easy to read.) s
376 28 M
(Finally, we will be looking at your code to see whether you have implemented) s
376 20 M
(minimax game tree search, and whether you use alpha-beta pruning.) s
